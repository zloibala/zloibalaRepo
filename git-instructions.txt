DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE FILES, to save file run "command + s" 

git add . - command that adds new files (code)
git status - command to check the status of all files

ggo - command to check history of our commit(our saved files)
When we run git log, we see:
1. Commit ID (COMMIT SHA/HASH)
2.(HEAD-> master or main) it means your bramch that you work on, or last commit.
3. Author who made commit
4. Date- when commit was made
5. commit message- what the commit is about
git log --oneline - check history

commit - means "save files, and add message" 
git commit -m "message" -commits the files to the local repository 
git commit --amend - command to change the message of the commit (will open VIM)
git reset ID_ofthecommit - command to delete commit 

 
 IN GIT WE HAVE 3 STAGES:

 1. Working stage - files that are not added 
 2. Staging - after we run command "git add ." - not files are staged 
 3. Commit - commited 

 FILES ALSO CAN HAVE 3 STATES: 
 1. Unmodified 
 2. Modified 
 3. Staged
